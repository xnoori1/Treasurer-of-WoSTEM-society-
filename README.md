# Treasurer-of-WoSTEM-society-
As Treasurer, I was responsible for managing the societyâ€™s finances and ensuring transparency for committee members. I created a balance sheet to track income and expenses throughout the year, embedding formulas so figures update automatically. This made it easier for the rest of the committee to monitor finances. 

For privacy and safety reasons, names and numbers have been replaced with examples!!!!
But all the formulas are still working!!
