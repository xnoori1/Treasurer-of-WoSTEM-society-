# Treasurer-of-WoSTEM-society-
As Treasurer, I was responsible for managing the societyâ€™s finances and ensuring transparency for committee members. I created a balance sheet to track income and expenses throughout the year, embedding formulas so figures update automatically. This made it easier for the rest of the committee to monitor finances.
